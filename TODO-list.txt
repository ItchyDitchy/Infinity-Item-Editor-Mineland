Hey, Ruukas, I've found some sliders in mob editor which cannot be translated directly in the ru_ru.lang file because there are no such tags like that. Example:
Size (of slime)
Random Skin, Unwilling/Willing
Ready to lay egg, %s ticks to lay egg
The whole Villager Trades Editor

Some simple missing tags like CanDestroy, CanPlaceOn
Chest tags (CustomName, Lock)

Less rotating wheel
